abstract: This paper explores the underutilized application of population sampling
  in the realm of actuarial science, a field where these statistical methodologies
  have been traditionally overlooked. Focusing on two distinct applications within
  insurance ratemaking and reserving, we unveil innovative approaches to address challenges
  in actuarial contexts and provide valuable insights into advancing methodologies
  in the field. The first application introduces population sampling as a solution
  to the computational complexities inherent in credibility premium calculation, particularly
  under Bayesian regression models. By combining population sampling with surrogate
  modeling, we present a method to manage computation challenges effectively. The
  second application delves into incurred but not reported reserves, challenging the
  conventional Chainâ€“Ladder method and individual reserving models by incorporating
  population sampling. Proposing a reserve estimator based on inverse probability
  weighting techniques, we demonstrate a statistically robust, distribution-free method
  for IBNR reserving, emphasizing the integration of granular policyholder information.
