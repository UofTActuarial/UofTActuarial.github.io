abstract: 'With the advancements in technology, telematics data that capture vehicle
  movement information are becoming available to more insurers. Because these data
  capture the actual driving behavior, they are expected to improve our understanding
  of driving risk and facilitate more accurate auto insurance ratemaking. In this
  article, we analyze an auto insurance dataset with telematics data collected from
  a major European insurer. Through a detailed discussion of the telematics data structure
  and related data quality issues, we elaborate on practical challenges in processing
  and incorporating telematics information in loss modeling and ratemaking. Then,
  with an exploratory data analysis, we demonstrate the existence of heterogeneity
  in individual driving behavior, even within the groups of policyholders with and
  without claims, which supports the study of telematics data. Our regression analysis
  reiterates the importance of telematics data in claims modeling; in particular,
  we propose a speed transition matrix that describes discretely recorded speed time
  series and produces statistically significant predictors for claim counts. We conclude
  that large speed transitions, together with higher maximum speed attained, nighttime
  driving, and increased harsh braking, are associated with increased claim counts.
  Moreover, we empirically illustrate the learning effects in driving behavior: we
  show that both severe harsh events detected at a high threshold and expected claim
  counts are not directly proportional with driving time or distance but they increase
  at a decreasing rate. '
