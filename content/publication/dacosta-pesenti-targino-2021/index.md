abstract: Risk budgeting is a portfolio strategy where each asset contributes a prespecified
  amount to the aggregate risk of the portfolio. In this work, we propose an efficient
  numerical framework that uses only simulations of returns for estimating risk budgeting
  portfolios. Besides a general cutting planes algorithm for determining the weights
  of risk budgeting portfolios for arbitrary coherent distortion risk measures, we
  provide a specialised version for the Expected Shortfall, and a tailored Stochastic
  Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, also for the Expected Shortfall. We compare our
  algorithm to standard convex optimisation solvers and illustrate different risk
  budgeting portfolios, constructed using an especially designed Julia package, on
  real financial data and compare it to classical portfolio strategies.
