abstract: An optimal reinsurance problem from the perspective of an insurer is studied
  in this paper, where an upper limit is imposed on a reinsurer's expected loss over
  a prescribed level. In order to reduce the moral hazard, we assume that both the
  insurer and the reinsurer are obligated to pay more as the amount of loss increases
  in a typical reinsurance treaty. We further assume that the optimization criterion
  preserves the convex order. Such a criterion is very general as most of the criteria
  for optimal reinsurance problems in the literature preserve the convex order. When
  the reinsurance premium is calculated as a function of the actuarial value of coverage,
  we show via a stochastic dominance approach that any admissible reinsurance policy
  is dominated by a stop-loss reinsurance or a two-layer reinsurance, depending upon
  the amount of the reinsurance premium. Moreover, we obtain a similar result to Mossin's
  Theorem and find that it is optimal for the insurer to cede a loss as much as possible
  under the net premium principle. To further examine the reinsurance premium for
  the optimal piecewise linear reinsurance policy, we assume the expected value premium
  principle and derive the optimal reinsurance explicitly under (1) the criterion
  of minimizing the variance of the insurer's risk exposure, and (2) the criterion
  of minimizing the risk-adjusted value of the insurer's liability where the liability
  valuation is carried out using the cost-of-capital approach based on the conditional
  value at risk.
