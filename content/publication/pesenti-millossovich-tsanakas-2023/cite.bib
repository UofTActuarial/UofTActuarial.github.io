 abstract = {Differential sensitivity measures provide valuable tools for interpreting complex computational models used in applications ranging from simulation to algorithmic prediction. Taking the derivative of the model output in direction of a model parameter can reveal input-output relations and the relative importance of model parameters and input variables. Nonetheless, it is unclear how such derivatives should be taken when the model function has discontinuities and/or input variables are discrete. We present a general framework for addressing such problems, considering derivatives of quantile-based output risk measures, with respect to distortions to random input variables (risk factors), which impact the model output through step-functions. We prove that, subject to weak technical conditions, the derivatives are well-defined and derive the corresponding formulas. We apply our results to the sensitivity analysis of compound risk models and to a numerical study of reinsurance credit risk in a multi-line insurance portfolio.},
