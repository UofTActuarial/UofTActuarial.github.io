abstract: In the past 25 years, computer scientists and statisticians developed machine
  learning algorithms capable of modeling highly nonlinear transformations and interactions
  of input features. While actuaries use GLMs frequently in practice, only in the
  past few years have they begun studying these newer algorithms to tackle insurance-related
  tasks. In this work, we aim to review the applications of machine learning to the
  actuarial science field and present the current state of the art in ratemaking and
  reserving. We first give an overview of neural networks, then briefly outline applications
  of machine learning algorithms in actuarial science tasks. Finally, we summarize
  the future trends of machine learning for the insurance industry.
