abstract: Incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserving is of great importance for
  Property & Casualty (P&C) insurers. However, the temporal dependence exhibited in
  the claim arrival process is not reflected in many current loss reserving models,
  which might affect the accuracy of the IBNR reserve predictions. To overcome this
  shortcoming, we proposed a marked Cox process and showed its many desirable properties
  in Badescu et al. (2016). In this paper, we consider the model estimation and applications.
  We first present an expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm which guarantees the
  efficiency of the estimators unlike the moment estimation methods widely used in
  estimating Cox processes. In addition, the proposed fitting algorithm can be implemented
  at a reasonable computational cost. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithm
  through simulation studies. The applicability of the proposed model is tested by
  fitting it to a real insurance claim data set. Through out-of-sample tests, we find
  that the proposed model can provide realistic predictive distributions.
