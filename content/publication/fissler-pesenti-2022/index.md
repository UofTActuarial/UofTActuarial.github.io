abstract: We propose a holistic framework for constructing sensitivity measures for
  any elicitable functional T of a response variable. The sensitivity measures, termed
  score-based sensitivities, are constructed via scoring functions that are (strictly)
  consistent for T. These score-based sensitivities quantify the relative improvement
  in predictive accuracy when available information, e.g., from explanatory variables,
  is used ideally. We establish intuitive and desirable properties of these sensitivities
  and discuss advantageous choices of scoring functions leading to scale-invariant
  sensitivities.  Since elicitable functionals typically possess rich classes of (strictly)
  consistent scoring functions, we demonstrate how Murphy diagrams can provide a picture
  of all score-based sensitivity measures. We discuss the family of score-based sensitivities
  for the mean functional (of which the Sobol indices are a special case) and risk
  functionals such as Value-at-Risk, and the pair Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall.
  The sensitivity measures are illustrated using numerous examples, including the
  Ishigami--Homma test function. In a simulation study, estimation of score-based
  sensitivities for a non-linear insurance portfolio is performed using neural nets.
