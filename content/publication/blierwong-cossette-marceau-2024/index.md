abstract: Copulas provide a powerful and flexible tool for modeling the dependence
  structure of random vectors, and they have many applications in finance, insurance,
  engineering, hydrology, and other fields. One well-known class of copulas in two
  dimensions is the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM) copula, since its simple analytic
  shape enables closed-form solutions to many problems in applied probability. However,
  the classical definition of the high-dimensional FGM copula does not enable a straightforward
  understanding of the effect of the copula parameters on the dependence, nor a geometric
  understanding of their admissible range. We circumvent this issue by analyzing the
  FGM copula from a probabilistic approach based on multivariate Bernoulli distributions.
  This paper examines high-dimensional exchangeable FGM copulas, a subclass of FGM
  copulas. We show that the dependence parameters of exchangeable FGM copulas can
  be expressed as a convex hull of a finite number of extreme points. We also leverage
  the probabilistic interpretation to develop efficient sampling and estimating procedures
  and provide a simulation study. Throughout, we discover geometric interpretations
  of the copula parameters that assist one in decoding the dependence of high-dimensional
  exchangeable FGM copulas.
