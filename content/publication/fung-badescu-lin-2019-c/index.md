abstract: 'Modeling multivariate time-series aggregate losses is an important actuarial
  topic that is very challenging due to the fact that losses can be serially dependent
  with heterogeneous dependence structures across loss types and business lines. In
  this paper, we investigate a flexible class of multivariate Cox Hidden Markov Models
  for the joint arrival process of loss events. Some of the nice properties possessed
  by this class of models, such as closed-form expressions, thinning properties and
  model versatility are discussed in details. We provide the expectation-maximization
  (EM) algorithm for efficient model calibration. Applying the proposed model to an
  operational risk dataset, we demonstrate that the model offers sufficient flexibility
  to capture most characteristics of the observed loss frequencies. By modeling the
  log-transformed loss severities through mixture of Erlang distributions, we can
  model the aggregate losses. Finally, out-of-sample testing shows that the proposed
  model is adequate to predict short-term future operational risk losses. '
