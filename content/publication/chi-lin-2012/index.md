abstract: A variable annuity (VA) is a deferred annuity that allows an annuitant to
  invest his/her contributions into a range of mutual funds. A separate account termed
  as sub-account is set up for the investment. Unlike a mutual fund, a VA offers a
  guaranteed minimum death benefit or GMDB and often offers a guaranteed minimum living
  benefit or GMLB during the accumulation phase of the VA contract. Almost all the
  research to date has focused on single premium variable annuities (SPVAs), i.e.
  it is assumed that an annuitant makes a single lump-sum contribution at the time
  of issue. In this paper, we study flexible premium variable annuities (FPVAs) that
  allow contributions during the accumulation phase. We derive a valuation formula
  for guarantees embedded in FPVAs and show that the delta hedging strategy for an
  FPVA is substantially different from that for an SPVA. The numerical examples illustrate
  that the cost in the form of mortality and expense (M&E) fee for an FPVA in many
  situations is significantly higher than the cost for a similar SPVA. This finding
  suggests that the current pricing practice by most VA providers that charges the
  same M&E fee for both should be re-examined.
