abstract: We propose an approach to construct a new family of generalized Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern
  (GFGM) copulas that naturally scales to high dimensions. A GFGM copula can model
  moderate positive and negative dependence, cover different types of asymmetries,
  and admits exact expressions for many quantities of interest such as measures of
  association or risk measures in actuarial science or quantitative risk management.
  More importantly, this paper presents a new method to construct high-dimensional
  copulas based on mixtures of power functions and may be adapted to more general
  contexts to construct broader families of copulas. We construct a family of copulas
  through a stochastic representation based on multivariate Bernoulli distributions
  and Coxian-2 distributions. This paper will cover the construction of a GFGM copula
  and study its measures of multivariate association and dependence properties. We
  explain how to sample random vectors from the new family of copulas in high dimensions.
  Then, we study the bivariate case in detail and find that our construction leads
  to an asymmetric modified Huang–Kotz FGM copula. Finally, we study the exchangeable
  case and provide insights into the most negative dependence structure within this
  new class of high-dimensional copulas.
