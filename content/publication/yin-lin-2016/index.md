abstract: The Erlang mixture model has been widely used in modeling insurance losses
  due to its desirable distributional properties. In this paper, we consider the problem
  of efficient estimation of the Erlang mixture model. We present a new thresholding
  penalty function and a corresponding EM algorithm to estimate model parameters and
  to determine the order of the mixture. Using simulation studies and a real data
  application, we demonstrate the efficiency of the EM algorithm.
