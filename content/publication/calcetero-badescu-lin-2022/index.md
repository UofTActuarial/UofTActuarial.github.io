abstract: Credibility, experience rating and more recently the so-called a posterior
  ratemaking in insurance consists in the determination of premiums that account for
  both the policyholders' attributes and their claim history. The models designed
  for such purposes are known as credibility models and fall under the same framework
  of Bayesian inference in statistics. Most of the data-driven models used for this
  task are mathematically intractable due to their complex structure, and therefore
  credibility premiums must be obtained via numerical methods e.g simulation via Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo. However, such methods are computationally expensive and even
  prohibitive for large portfolios when these must be applied at the policyholder
  level. In addition, these computations are ``black-box\" procedures for actuaries
  as there is no clear expression showing how the claim history of policyholders is
  used to upgrade their premiums. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose
  a methodology to derive a closed-form expression to compute credibility premiums
  for any given Bayesian model. We do so by introducing a credibility index, that
  works as an efficient summary statistic of the claim history of a policyholder,
  and illustrate how it can be used as the main input to approximate any credibility
  formula. The closed-form solution can be used to reduce the computational burden
  of a posteriori ratemaking for large portfolios via the same idea of surrogate modeling,
  and also provides a transparent way of computing premiums from which practical interpretations
  and risk assessments can be performed.
