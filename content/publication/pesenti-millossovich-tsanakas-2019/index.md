abstract: 'Sensitivity analysis is an important component of model building, interpretation
  and validation. A model comprises a vector of random input factors, an aggregation
  function mapping input factors to a random output, and a (baseline) probability
  measure. A risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, maps the
  distribution of the output to the real line. As is common in risk management, the
  value of the risk measure applied to the output is a decision variable. Therefore,
  it is of interest to associate a critical increase in the risk measure to specific
  input factors. We propose a global and model-independent framework, termed ‘reverse
  sensitivity testing’, comprising three steps: (a) an output stress is specified,
  corresponding to an increase in the risk measure(s); (b) a (stressed) probability
  measure is derived, minimising the Kullback–Leibler divergence with respect to the
  baseline probability, under constraints generated by the output stress; (c) changes
  in the distributions of input factors are evaluated. We argue that a substantial
  change in the distribution of an input factor corresponds to high sensitivity to
  that input and introduce a novel sensitivity measure to formalise this insight.
  Implementation of reverse sensitivity testing in a Monte Carlo setting can be performed
  on a single set of input/output scenarios, simulated under the baseline model. Thus
  the approach circumvents the need for additional computationally expensive evaluations
  of the aggregation function. We illustrate the proposed approach through numerical
  examples with a simple insurance portfolio and a model of a London Insurance Market
  portfolio used in industry.'
