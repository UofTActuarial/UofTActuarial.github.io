abstract: This paper focuses on the estimation and application aspects of the Erlang
  count logit-weighted reduced mixture of experts model (EC-LRMoE), which is a fully
  flexible multivariate insurance claim frequency regression model. We first prove
  the identifiability property of the proposed model to ensure that it is a suitable
  candidate for statistical inference. An expectation conditional maximization (ECM)
  algorithm is developed for efficient model calibrations. Three simulation studies
  are performed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed ECM algorithm and the
  versatility of the proposed model. The applicability of the EC-LRMoE is shown through
  fitting an European automobile insurance data set. Since the data set contains several
  complex features, we find it necessary to adopt such a flexible model. Apart from
  showing excellent fitting results, we are able to interpret the fitted model in
  an insurance perspective and to visualize the relationship between policyholdersâ€™
  information and their risk level. Finally, we demonstrate how the fitted model may
  be useful for insurance ratemaking.
