abstract: 'We study the problem of active portfolio management where an investor aims
  to outperform a benchmark strategy’s risk profile while not deviating too far from
  it. Specifically, an investor considers alternative strategies whose terminal wealth
  lies within a Wasserstein ball surrounding a benchmark’s terminal wealth—being distributionally
  close—and that have a specified dependence/copula tying state-by-state outcomes
  to it. The investor then chooses the alternative strategy that minimizes a distortion
  risk measure of terminal wealth. In a general complete market model, we prove that
  an optimal dynamic strategy exists and provide its characterization through the
  notion of isotonic projections. We further propose a simulation approach to calculate
  the optimal strategy’s terminal wealth, making our approach applicable to a wide
  range of market models. Finally, we illustrate how investors with different copula
  and risk preferences invest and improve upon the benchmark using the Tail Value-at-Risk,
  inverse S-shaped, and lower- and upper-tail distortion risk measures as examples.
  We find that investors’ optimal terminal wealth distribution has larger probability
  masses in regions that reduce their risk measure relative to the benchmark while
  preserving the benchmark’s structure. '
