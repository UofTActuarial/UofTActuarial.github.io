abstract: We study the problem of active portfolio management where an investor aims
  to outperform a benchmark strategy's risk profile while not deviating too far from
  it. Specifically, an investor considers alternative strategies whose terminal wealth
  lie within a Wasserstein ball surrounding a benchmark's -- being distributionally
  close -- and that have a specified dependence/copula -- tying state-by-state outcomes
  -- to it. The investor then chooses the alternative strategy that minimises a distortion
  risk measure of terminal wealth. In a general (complete) market model, we prove
  that an optimal dynamic strategy exists and provide its characterisation through
  the notion of isotonic projections. We further propose a simulation approach to
  calculate the optimal strategy's terminal wealth, making our approach applicable
  to a wide range of market models. Finally, we illustrate how investors with different
  copula and risk preferences invest and improve upon the benchmark using the Tail
  Value-at-Risk, inverse S-shaped, and lower- and upper-tail distortion risk measures
  as examples. We find that investors' optimal terminal wealth distribution has larger
  probability masses in regions that reduce their risk measure relative to the benchmark
  while preserving the benchmark's structure.
