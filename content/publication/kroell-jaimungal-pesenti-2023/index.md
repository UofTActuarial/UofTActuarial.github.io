abstract: We study a reinsurer who faces multiple sources of model uncertainty. The
  reinsurer offers contracts to n insurers whose claims follow compound Poisson processes
  representing both idiosyncratic and systemic sources of loss. As the reinsurer is
  uncertain about the insurers’ claim severity distributions and frequencies, they
  design reinsurance contracts that maximise their expected wealth subject to an entropy
  penalty. Insurers meanwhile seek to maximise their expected utility without ambiguity.
  We solve this continuous-time Stackelberg game for general reinsurance contracts
  and find that the reinsurer prices under a distortion of the barycentre of the insurers’
  models. We apply our results to proportional reinsurance and excess-of-loss reinsurance
  contracts, and illustrate the solutions numerically. Furthermore, we solve the related
  problem where the reinsurer maximises, still under ambiguity, their expected utility
  and compare the solutions.
