abstract: 'Insurance loss severity data often exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, complex
  distributional characteristics such as multimodality, and peculiar links between
  policyholdersâ€™ risk profiles and claim amounts. To capture these features, we propose
  a transformed Gamma logit-weighted mixture of experts (TG-LRMoE) model for severity
  regression. The model possesses several desirable properties. The TG-LRMoE satisfies
  the denseness property that warrants its full versatility in capturing any distribution
  and regression structures. It may effectively extrapolate a wide range of tail behavior.
  The model is also identifiable, which further ensures its suitability for statistical
  inference. To make the TG-LRMoE computationally tractable, an expectation conditional
  maximization (ECM) algorithm with parameter penalization is developed for efficient
  and robust parameter estimation. The proposed model is applied to fit the severity
  and reporting delay components of a European automobile insurance dataset. In addition
  to obtaining excellent goodness of fit, the proposed model is shown to be useful
  and crucial for adequate prediction of incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves
  through out-of-sample testing. '
