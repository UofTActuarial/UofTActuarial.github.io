abstract: ' In this article, an optimal reinsurance problem is formulated from the
  perspective of an insurer, with the objective of minimizing the risk-adjusted value
  of its liability where the valuation is carried out by a cost-of-capital approach
  and the capital at risk is calculated by either the value-at-risk (VaR) or conditional
  value-at-risk (CVaR). In our reinsurance arrangement, we also assume that both insurer
  and reinsurer are obligated to pay more for a larger realization of loss as a way
  of reducing ex post moral hazard. A key contribution of this article is to expand
  the research on optimal reinsurance by deriving explicit optimal reinsurance solutions
  under an economic premium principle. It is a rather general class of premium principles
  that includes many weighted premium principles as special cases. The advantage of
  adopting such a premium principle is that the resulting reinsurance premium depends
  not only on the risk ceded but also on a market economic factor that reflects the
  market environment or the risk the reinsurer is facing. This feature appears to
  be more consistent with the reinsurance market. We show that the optimal reinsurance
  policies are piecewise linear under both VaR and CVaR risk measures. While the structures
  of optimal reinsurance solutions are the same for both risk measures, we also formally
  show that there are some significant differences, particularly on the managing tail
  risk. Because of the integration of the market factor (via the reinsurance pricing)
  into the optimal reinsurance model, some new insights on the optimal reinsurance
  design could be gleaned, which would otherwise be impossible for many of the existing
  models. For example, the market factor has a nontrivial effect on the optimal reinsurance,
  which is greatly influenced by the changes of the joint distribution of the market
  factor and the loss. Finally, under an additional assumption that the market factor
  and the loss have a copula with quadratic sections, we demonstrate that the optimal
  reinsurance policies admit relatively simple forms to foster the applicability of
  our theoretical results, and a numerical example is presented to further highlight
  our results. '
