abstract: Unstructured data are a promising new source of information that insurance
  companies may use to understand their risk portfolio better and improve the customer
  experience. However, these novel data sources are difficult to incorporate into
  existing ratemaking frameworks due to the size and format of the unstructured data.
  This paper proposes a framework to use street view imagery within a generalized
  linear model. To do so, we use representation learning to extract an embedding vector
  containing useful information from the image. This embedding is dense and low dimensional,
  making it appropriate to use within existing ratemaking models. We find that there
  is useful information included in street view imagery to predict the frequency of
  claims for certain types of perils. This model can be used as in a ratemaking framework
  but also opens the door to future empirical research on attempting to extract which
  characteristics within the image leads to increased or decreased predicted claim
  frequencies. Throughout, we discuss the practical difficulties (technical and social)
  of using this type of data for insurance pricing.
