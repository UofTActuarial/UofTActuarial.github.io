abstract: 'Claim reserving in insurance has been studied through two primary frameworks:
  the macro-level approach, which estimates reserves at an aggregate level (e.g.,
  Chain-Ladder), and the micro-level approach, which estimates reserves at the individual
  claim level Antonio and Plat (2014). These frameworks are based on fundamentally
  different theoretical foundations, creating a degree of incompatibility that limits
  the adoption of more flexible models. This paper introduces a unified statistical
  framework for claim reserving, grounded in population sampling theory. We show that
  macro- and micro-level models represent extreme yet natural cases of an augmented
  inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator. This formulation allows for a seamless
  integration of principles from both aggregate and individual models, enabling more
  accurate and flexible estimations. Moreover, this paper also addresses critical
  issues of sampling bias arising from partially observed claims data-an often overlooked
  challenge in insurance. By adapting advanced statistical methods from the sampling
  literature, such as double-robust estimators, weighted estimating equations, and
  synthetic data generation, we improve predictive accuracy and expand the tools available
  for actuaries. The framework is illustrated using Canadian auto insurance data,
  highlighting the practical benefits of the sampling-based methods.'
