abstract: Major (2018) discusses Euler/Aumann–Shapley allocations for non-linear positively
  homogeneous portfolios. For such portfolio structures, plausibly arising in the
  context of reinsurance, he defines a distortion-type risk measure that facilitates
  assessment of ceded and net losses with reference to gross portfolio outcomes. Subsequently,
  Major (2018) derives explicit formulas for Euler allocations for this risk measure,
  thus (sub-)allocating ceded losses to the portfolio’s original components. In this
  comment, we build on Major’s (2018) insights but take a somewhat different direction,
  to consider Euler capital allocations for distortion risk measures directly applied
  to homogeneous portfolios. Explicit formulas are derived and our approach is compared
  with that of Major (2018) via a numerical example.
