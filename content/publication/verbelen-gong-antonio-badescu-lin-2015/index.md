abstract: We discuss how to fit mixtures of Erlangs to censored and truncated data
  by iteratively using the EM algorithm. Mixtures of Erlangs form a very versatile,
  yet analytically tractable, class of distributions making them suitable for loss
  modeling purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on
  simulated data as well as real data sets.
