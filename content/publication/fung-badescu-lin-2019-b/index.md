abstract: 'In the Property and Casualty (P&C) ratemaking process, it is critical to
  understand the effect of policyholders’ risk profile to the number and amount of
  claims, the dependence among various business lines and the claim distributions.
  To include all the above features, it is essential to develop a regression model
  which is flexible and theoretically justified. Motivated by the issues above, we
  propose a class of logit-weighted reduced mixture of experts (LRMoE) models for
  multivariate claim frequencies or severities distributions. LRMoE is interpretable,
  as it has two components: Gating functions, which classify policyholders into various
  latent sub-classes; and Expert functions, which govern the distributional properties
  of the claims. Also, upon the development of denseness theory in regression setting,
  we can heuristically interpret the LRMoE as a “fully flexible” model to capture
  any distributional, dependence and regression structures subject to a denseness
  condition. Further, the mathematical tractability of the LRMoE is guaranteed since
  it satisfies various marginalization and moment properties. Finally, we discuss
  some special choices of expert functions that make the corresponding LRMoE “fully
  flexible”. In the subsequent paper (Fung et al., 2019b), we will focus on the estimation
  and application aspects of the LRMoE.'
