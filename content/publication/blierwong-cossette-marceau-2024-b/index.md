abstract: "We study copula-based collective risk models when the dependence structure\
  \ is defined by a Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula. By leveraging a one-to-one\
  \ correspondence between the class of FGM copulas and multivariate symmetric Bernoulli\
  \ distributions, we find convenient representations for the moments and Laplace-Stieltjes\
  \ transform for the aggregate random variable defined from collective risk models\
  \ with FGM dependence. We examine different components of this collective risk model,\
  \ aiming to better understand the impact of the assumed dependence between a claim's\
  \ frequency and severity. Relying on stochastic ordering, we analyze the impact\
  \ of dependence on the aggregate claim amount random variable. Even if the FGM copula\
  \ may only induce moderate dependence, we illustrate through numerical examples\
  \ that the cumulative effect of FGM dependence can lead to substantial variations\
  \ in key risk measures on aggregate random variables defined from collective risk\
  \ models. "
