abstract: We employ scoring functions, used in statistics for eliciting risk functionals,
  as cost functions in the Monge-Kantorovich (MK) optimal transport problem. This
  gives raise to a rich variety of novel asymmetric MK divergences, which subsume
  the family of Bregman-Wasserstein divergences. We show that for distributions on
  the real line, the comonotonic coupling is optimal for the majority of the new divergences.
  Specifically, we derive the optimal coupling of the MK divergences induced by functionals
  including the mean, generalised quantiles, expectiles, and shortfall measures. Furthermore,
  we show that while any elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measure gives raise
  to infinitely many MK divergences, the comonotonic coupling is simultaneously optimal.
  The novel MK divergences, which can be efficiently calculated, open an array of
  applications in robust stochastic optimisation. We derive sharp bounds on distortion
  risk measures under a Bregman-Wasserstein divergence constraint, and solve for cost-efficient
  payoffs under benchmark constraints.
