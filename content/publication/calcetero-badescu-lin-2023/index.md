abstract: Claim reserving primarily relies on macro-level models, with the Chain-Ladder
  method being the most widely adopted. These methods were heuristically developed
  without minimal statistical foundations, relying on oversimplified data assumptions
  and neglecting policyholder heterogeneity, often resulting in conservative reserve
  predictions. Micro-level reserving, utilizing stochastic modeling with granular
  information,  can improve predictions but tends to involve less attractive and complex
  models for practitioners. This paper aims to strike a practical balance between
  aggregate and individual models by introducing a methodology that enables the Chain-Ladder
  method to incorporate individual information. We achieve this by proposing a novel
  framework, formulating the claim reserving problem within a population sampling
  context. We introduce a reserve estimator in a frequency and severity distribution-free
  manner that utilizes inverse probability weights (IPW) driven by individual information,
  akin to propensity scores. We demonstrate that the Chain-Ladder method emerges as
  a particular case of such an IPW estimator, thereby inheriting a statistically sound
  foundation based on population sampling theory that enables the use of granular
  information, and other extensions.
