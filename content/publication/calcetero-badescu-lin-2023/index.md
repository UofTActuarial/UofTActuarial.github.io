abstract: Claim reserving is primarily accomplished using macro-level or aggregate
  models, with the Chain-Ladder method being the most popular one. However, these
  methods are heuristically constructed, rely on oversimplified data assumptions,
  neglect the heterogeneity of policyholders, and so lead to a lack of accuracy. In
  contrast, micro-level reserving leverages on stochastic modeling with granular information
  for improved predictions, but usually comes at the cost of more complex models that
  are unattractive to practitioners. In this paper, we introduce a simplistic macro-level
  type approach that can incorporate granular information at the individual level.
  We do so by considering a novel framework in which we view the claim reserving problem
  as a population sampling problem and propose an estimator using inverse probability
  weighting techniques, with weights driven by policyholder attributes. The framework
  provides a statistically sound method for aggregate claim reserving in a frequency
  and severity distribution-free fashion, while also incorporating the capability
  to utilize granular information via a regression-type framework. The resulting reserve
  estimator has the attractiveness of resembling the Chain-Ladder claim development
  principle but applied at the individual claim level, so it is easy to interpret
  by actuaries, and more appealing to practitioners as an extension of a macro-model.
