abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Cramér–Lundberg risk model perturbed by
  diffusion to incorporate jumps due to surplus fluctuation and to relax the positive
  loading condition. Assuming that the surplus process has exponential upward and
  arbitrary downward jumps, we analyze the expected discounted penalty (EDP) function
  of Gerber and Shiu (1998) under the threshold dividend strategy. An integral equation
  for the EDP function is derived using the Wiener–Hopf factorization. As a result,
  an explicit analytical expression is obtained for the EDP function by solving the
  integral equation. Finally, phase-type downward jumps are considered and a matrix
  representation of the EDP function is presented.
