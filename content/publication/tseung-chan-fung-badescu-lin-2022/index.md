abstract: A well-designed framework for risk classification and ratemaking in automobile
  insurance is key to insurers' profitability and risk management, while also ensuring
  that policyholders are charged a fair premium according to their risk profile. In
  this paper, we propose to adapt a flexible regression model, called the Mixed LRMoE,
  to the problem of a posteriori risk classification and ratemaking, where policyholder-level
  random effects are incorporated to better infer their risk profile reflected by
  the claim history. We also develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Conditional-Maximization
  algorithm for estimating model parameters and inferring the posterior distribution
  of random effects, which is numerically efficient and scalable to large insurance
  portfolios. We then apply the Mixed LRMoE model to a real, multiyear automobile
  insurance dataset, where the proposed framework is shown to offer better fit to
  data and produce posterior premium which accurately reflects policyholders' claim
  history.
