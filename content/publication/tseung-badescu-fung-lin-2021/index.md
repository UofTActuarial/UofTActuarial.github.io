abstract: This paper introduces a new julia package, LRMoE, a statistical software
  tailor-made for actuarial applications, which allows actuarial researchers and practitioners
  to model and analyse insurance loss frequencies and severities using the Logit-weighted
  Reduced Mixture-of-Experts (LRMoE) model. LRMoE offers several new distinctive features
  which are motivated by various actuarial applications and mostly cannot be achieved
  using existing packages for mixture models. Key features include a wider coverage
  on frequency and severity distributions and their zero inflation, the flexibility
  to vary classes of distributions across components, parameter estimation under data
  censoring and truncation and a collection of insurance ratemaking and reserving
  functions. The package also provides several model evaluation and visualisation
  functions to help users easily analyse the performance of the fitted model and interpret
  the model in insurance contexts.
