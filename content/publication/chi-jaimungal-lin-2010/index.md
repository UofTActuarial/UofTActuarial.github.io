abstract: In this paper, we extend the Cramér–Lundberg insurance risk model perturbed
  by diffusion to incorporate stochastic volatility and study the resulting Gerber–Shiu
  expected discounted penalty (EDP) function. Under the assumption that volatility
  is driven by an underlying Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we derive the integro-differential
  equation which the EDP function satisfies. Not surprisingly, no closed-form solution
  exists; however, assuming the driving OU process is fast mean-reverting, we apply
  the singular perturbation theory to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the solution.
  Two integro-differential equations for the first two terms in this expansion are
  obtained and explicitly solved. When the claim size distribution is of phase-type,
  the asymptotic results simplify even further and we succeed in estimating the error
  of the approximation. Hyper-exponential and mixed-Erlang distributed claims are
  considered in some detail.
