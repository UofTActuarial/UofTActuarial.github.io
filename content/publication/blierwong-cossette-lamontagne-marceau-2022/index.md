abstract: 'Spatial data are a rich source of information for actuarial applications:
  knowledge of a risk’s location could improve an insurance company’s ratemaking,
  reserving or risk management processes. Relying on historical geolocated loss data
  is problematic for areas where it is limited or unavailable. In this paper, we construct
  spatial embeddings within a complex convolutional neural network representation
  model using external census data and use them as inputs to a simple predictive model.
  Compared to spatial interpolation models, our approach leads to smaller predictive
  bias and reduced variance in most situations. This method also enables us to generate
  rates in territories with no historical experience.'
