abstract: We offer a new perspective on risk aggregation with FGM copulas. Along the
  way, we discover new results and revisit existing ones, providing simpler formulas
  than one can find in the existing literature. This paper builds on two novel representations
  of FGM copulas based on symmetric multivariate Bernoulli distributions and order
  statistics. First, we detail families of multivariate distributions with closed-form
  solutions for the cumulative distribution function or moments of the aggregate random
  variables. We provide methods to compute the cumulative distribution function of
  aggregate rvs when the marginals are discrete, then order aggregate random variables
  under the convex order. Finally, we discuss risk-sharing and capital allocation,
  providing numerical examples for each.
