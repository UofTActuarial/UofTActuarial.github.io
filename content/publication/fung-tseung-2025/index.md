abstract: Multilevel data are prevalent in many real-world applications. However,
  it remains an open research problem to identify and justify a class of models that
  flexibly capture a wide range of multilevel data. Motivated by the versatility of
  the mixture of experts (MoE) models in fitting regression data, in this article
  we extend upon the MoE and study a class of mixed MoE (MMoE) models for multilevel
  data. Under some regularity conditions, we prove that the MMoE is dense in the space
  of any continuous mixed effects models in the sense of weak convergence. As a result,
  the MMoE has a potential to accurately resemble almost all characteristics inherited
  in multilevel data, including the marginal distributions, dependence structures,
  regression links, random intercepts and random slopes. In a particular case where
  the multilevel data is hierarchical, we further show that a nested version of the
  MMoE universally approximates a broad range of dependence structures of the random
  effects among different factor levels.
