abstract: Optimization of distortion riskmetrics with distributional uncertainty has
  wide applications in finance and operations research. Distortion riskmetrics include
  many commonly applied risk measures and deviation measures, which are not necessarily
  monotone or convex. One of our central findings is a unifying result that allows
  us to convert an optimization of a non-convex distortion riskmetric with distributional
  uncertainty to a convex one, leading to great tractability. A sufficient condition
  to the unifying equivalence result is the novel notion of closedness under concentration,
  a variation of which is also shown to be necessary for the equivalence. Our results
  include many special cases that are well studied in the optimization literature,
  including but not limited to optimizing probabilities, Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall,
  Yaari's dual utility, and differences between distortion risk measures, under various
  forms of distributional uncertainty. We illustrate our theoretical results via applications
  to portfolio optimization, optimization under moment constraints, and preference
  robust optimization.
