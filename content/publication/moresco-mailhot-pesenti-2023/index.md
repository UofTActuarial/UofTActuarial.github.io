abstract: We introduce a framework for quantifying propagation of uncertainty arising
  in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we define dynamic uncertainty sets designed
  explicitly for discrete stochastic processes over a finite time horizon. These dynamic
  uncertainty sets capture the uncertainty surrounding stochastic processes and models,
  accounting for factors such as distributional ambiguity. Examples of uncertainty
  sets include those induced by the Wasserstein distance and f-divergences. We further
  define dynamic robust risk measures as the supremum of all candidates' risks within
  the uncertainty set. In an axiomatic way, we discuss conditions on the uncertainty
  sets that lead to well-known properties of dynamic robust risk measures, such as
  convexity and coherence. Furthermore, we discuss the necessary and sufficient properties
  of dynamic uncertainty sets that lead to time-consistencies of dynamic robust risk
  measures. We find that uncertainty sets stemming from f-divergences lead to strong
  time-consistency while the Wasserstein distance results in a new time-consistent
  notion of weak recursiveness. Moreover, we show that a dynamic robust risk measure
  is strong time-consistent or weak recursive if and only if it admits a recursive
  representation of one-step conditional robust risk measures arising from static
  uncertainty sets.
