abstract: "A one-to-one correspondence between Fréchet's class of multivariate Bernoulli\
  \ distribution with symmetric marginals and the well-known family of Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern\
  \ (FGM) copulas is established. A new stochastic representation of the family of\
  \ d-variate FGM copulas is introduced. The representation is bijective: from any\
  \ d-variate Bernoulli distribution, one may define a corresponding d-variate FGM\
  \ copula; and for any d-variate FGM copula, one finds the corresponding d-variate\
  \ Bernoulli distribution. The proposed stochastic representation has many advantages,\
  \ notably establishing stochastic orders, constructing subclasses of FGM copulas\
  \ and sampling. In particular, one may use the stochastic representation to develop\
  \ computational methods to perform sampling from subclasses of FGM copulas, which\
  \ scale well to large dimensions."
