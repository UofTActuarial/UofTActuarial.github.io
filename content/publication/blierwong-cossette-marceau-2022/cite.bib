 abstract = {A one-to-one correspondence between Fréchet's class of multivariate Bernoulli distribution with symmetric marginals and the well-known family of Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copulas is established. A new stochastic representation of the family of d-variate FGM copulas is introduced. The representation is bijective: from any d-variate Bernoulli distribution, one may define a corresponding d-variate FGM copula; and for any d-variate FGM copula, one finds the corresponding d-variate Bernoulli distribution. The proposed stochastic representation has many advantages, notably establishing stochastic orders, constructing subclasses of FGM copulas and sampling. In particular, one may use the stochastic representation to develop computational methods to perform sampling from subclasses of FGM copulas, which scale well to large dimensions.},
