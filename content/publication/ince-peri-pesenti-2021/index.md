abstract: Risk contributions of portfolios form an indispensable part of risk adjusted
  performance measurement. The risk contribution of a portfolio, e.g., in the Euler
  or Aumann-Shapley framework, is given by the partial derivatives of a risk measure
  applied to the portfolio profit and loss in direction of the asset units. For risk
  measures that are not positively homogeneous of degree 1, however, known capital
  allocation principles do not apply. We study the class of lambda quantile risk measures
  that includes the well-known Value-at-Risk as a special case but for which no known
  allocation rule is applicable. We prove differentiability and derive explicit formulae
  of the derivatives of lambda quantiles with respect to their portfolio composition,
  that is their risk contribution. For this purpose, we define lambda quantiles on
  the space of portfolio compositions and consider generic (also non-linear) portfolio
  operators.  We further derive the Euler decomposition of lambda quantiles for generic
  portfolios and show that lambda quantiles are homogeneous in the space of portfolio
  compositions, with a homogeneity degree that depends on the portfolio composition
  and the lambda function. This result is in stark contrast to the positive homogeneity
  properties of risk measures defined on the space of random variables which admit
  a constant homogeneity degree. We introduce a generalised version of Euler contributions
  and Euler allocation rule, which are compatible with risk measures of any homogeneity
  degree and non-linear but homogeneous portfolios. These concepts are illustrated
  by a non-linear portfolio using financial market data.
