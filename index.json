Using this information, researchers are now able to engineer synthetic genetic circuits for a range of applications in the environmental, medical, and energy domains. Crucial to the success of these efforts is the development of methods and tools for the design of these genetic circuits. While inspiration can be drawn from experiences with electronic design, design with a genetic material poses several challenges. In particular, genetic circuits are composed of very noisy components making their behavior more asynchronous, analog, and stochastic in nature. This course will present recent research into new methods and software tools for the modeling, analysis, and design of genetic circuits that are enabling this exciting new field of synthetic biology. As in the sequencing of the human genome, collaborations between engineers and biologists will be essential to the success of synthetic biology. Therefore, the goal of this course is to facilitate these collaborations by teaching both the biological and engineering principles necessary for such research.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f50eaba96ff4c09df8eceab2ea72bdad","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/author/engineering-genetic-circuits/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/engineering-genetic-circuits/","section":"authors","summary":"With the sequencing of the human genome and the genomes of other organisms, we now have a list of the parts that make up these genetic systems.

In particular, many parts used in synthetic biology come from or are initially tested in a simple bacteria, E. coli, but many potential applications in energy, agriculture, materials, and health require either different bacteria or higher level organisms (yeast for example). Currently, researchers use a trial-and-error approach because they cannot find reliable information about prior experiments with a given part of interest. This process simply cannot scale. Therefore, to achieve scale, a wide range of data must be harnessed to allow confidence to be determined about the likelihood of success. The quantity of data and the exponential increase in the publications generated by this field is creating a tipping point, but this data is not readily accessible to practitioners. To address this challenge, our multidisciplinary team of biological engineers, machine learning experts, data scientists, library scientists, and social scientists will build a knowledge system integrating disparate data and publication repositories in order to deliver effective and efficient access to collectively available information; doing so will enable expedited, knowledge-based synthetic biology design research.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b728e5fe1ef2212051872d1b5fed76c2","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/author/synthetic-biology-knowledge-system/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/synthetic-biology-knowledge-system/","section":"authors","summary":"The scientific challenge for this project is to accelerate discovery and exploration of the synthetic biology design space.

Key features include a wider coverage on frequency and severity distributions and their zero inflation, the flexibility to vary classes of distributions across components, parameter estimation under data censoring and truncation and a collection of insurance ratemaking and reserving functions.

We first prove the identifiability property of the proposed model to ensure that it is a suitable candidate for statistical inference. An expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm is developed for efficient model calibrations. Three simulation studies are performed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed ECM algorithm and the versatility of the proposed model. The applicability of the EC-LRMoE is shown through fitting an European automobile insurance data set. Since the data set contains several complex features, we find it necessary to adopt such a flexible model. Apart from showing excellent fitting results, we are able to interpret the fitted model in an insurance perspective and to visualize the relationship between policyholders’ information and their risk level. Finally, we demonstrate how the fitted model may be useful for insurance ratemaking.","tags":[],"title":"A class of mixture of experts models for general insurance: application to correlated claim frequencies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/courses/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60abaeb405147d861bb55801d25d30df","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"844bee0c0f880bae2b528cbc3f39219f","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/people-genetic-logic-lab/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people-genetic-logic-lab/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"21e663c1b3575996cdbb4c33539ad396","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/people-uoftactuarial/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people-uoftactuarial/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"850d3285b9d4b0dba29acf3237d91a0c","permalink":"https://uoftactuarial.github.io/tools/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tools/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tools","type":"widget_page"}]
