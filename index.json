The models designed for such purposes are known as credibility models and fall under the same framework of Bayesian inference in statistics. Most of the data-driven models used for this task are mathematically intractable due to their complex structure, and therefore credibility premiums must be obtained via numerical methods e.g simulation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo. However, such methods are computationally expensive and even prohibitive for large portfolios when these must be applied at the policyholder level. In addition, these computations are ``black-box\\\" procedures for actuaries as there is no clear expression showing how the claim history of policyholders is used to upgrade their premiums. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a methodology to derive a closed-form expression to compute credibility premiums for any given Bayesian model. We do so by introducing a credibility index, that works as an efficient summary statistic of the claim history of a policyholder, and illustrate how it can be used as the main input to approximate any credibility formula. The closed-form solution can be used to reduce the computational burden of a posteriori ratemaking for large portfolios via the same idea of surrogate modeling, and also provides a transparent way of computing premiums from which practical interpretations and risk assessments can be performed.","tags":[],"title":"A Credibility Index Approach for Effective a Posteriori Ratemaking with Large Insurance Portfolios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Spark C.

In this paper, we propose to adapt a flexible regression model, called the Mixed LRMoE, to the problem of a posteriori risk classification and ratemaking, where policyholder-level random effects are incorporated to better infer their risk profile reflected by the claim history. We also develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Conditional-Maximization algorithm for estimating model parameters and inferring the posterior distribution of random effects, which is numerically efficient and scalable to large insurance portfolios. We then apply the Mixed LRMoE model to a real, multiyear automobile insurance dataset, where the proposed framework is shown to offer better fit to data and produce posterior premium which accurately reflects policyholders' claim history.","tags":["Applications (stat.AP)","Econometrics (econ.EM)","Methodology (stat.ME)","FOS: Computer and information sciences","FOS: Computer and information sciences","FOS: Economics and business","FOS: Economics and business"],"title":"A Posteriori Risk Classification and Ratemaking with Random Effects in the Mixture-of-Experts Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tsz Chai Fung","Andrei L.

Though it has shown usefulness in modeling insurance loss frequencies and severities, model calibration becomes challenging when censored and truncated data are involved, which is common in actuarial practice. In this article, we present an extended expectation–conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm that efficiently fits the LRMoE to random censored and random truncated regression data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is empirically examined through a simulation study. Using real automobile insurance data sets, the usefulness and importance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through two actuarial applications: individual claim reserving and deductible ratemaking.

Under some regularity conditions, we prove that the MMoE is dense in the space of any continuous mixed effects models in the sense of weak convergence. As a result, the MMoE has a potential to accurately resemble almost all characteristics inherited in multilevel data, including the marginal distributions, dependence structures, regression links, random intercepts and random slopes. In a particular case where the multilevel data is hierarchical, we further show that a nested version of the MMoE universally approximates a broad range of dependence structures of the random effects among different factor levels.","tags":["Statistics Theory (math.ST)","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)","Methodology (stat.ME)","FOS: Mathematics","FOS: Mathematics","FOS: Computer and information sciences","FOS: Computer and information sciences"],"title":"Mixture of experts models for multilevel data: modelling framework and approximation theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernardo Freitas Paulo da Costa","Silvana M.

The risk contribution of a portfolio, e.g., in the Euler or Aumann-Shapley framework, is given by the partial derivatives of a risk measure applied to the portfolio profit and loss in direction of the asset units. For risk measures that are not positively homogeneous of degree 1, however, known capital allocation principles do not apply. We study the class of lambda quantile risk measures that includes the well-known Value-at-Risk as a special case but for which no known allocation rule is applicable. We prove differentiability and derive explicit formulae of the derivatives of lambda quantiles with respect to their portfolio composition, that is their risk contribution. For this purpose, we define lambda quantiles on the space of portfolio compositions and consider generic (also non-linear) portfolio operators.  We further derive the Euler decomposition of lambda quantiles for generic portfolios and show that lambda quantiles are homogeneous in the space of portfolio compositions, with a homogeneity degree that depends on the portfolio composition and the lambda function. This result is in stark contrast to the positive homogeneity properties of risk measures defined on the space of random variables which admit a constant homogeneity degree. We introduce a generalised version of Euler contributions and Euler allocation rule, which are compatible with risk measures of any homogeneity degree and non-linear but homogeneous portfolios. These concepts are illustrated by a non-linear portfolio using financial market data.","tags":[],"title":"Risk Contributions of Lambda Quantiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Jaimungal","Silvana M.

Hedging the market risks is therefore crucial in risk managing a VA portfolio as the VA guarantees are long-dated liability that may span over decades. In order to hedge the VA liability, the issuing insurance company would need to construct a hedging portfolio consisting of the underlying assets whose positions are often determined by the liability Greeks such as partial dollar Deltas. Usually, these quantities are calculated via nested simulation. For insurance companies that manage large VA portfolios (e.g.,100K+ policies), calculating those quantities is extremely time-consuming or even prohibitive due to the complexity of the guarantee payoffs and the stochastic-on-stochastic nature of the nested simulation algorithm. In this paper, we extend the surrogate model-assisted nest simulation approach in Lin \u0026Yang (2020) to efficiently calculate the total VA liability and the partial dollar Deltas for large VA portfolios with multiple underlying assets. In our proposed algorithm, the nested simulation is run using small sets of selected representative policies and representative outer-loops. As a result, the computing time is substantially reduced. The computational advantage of the proposed algorithm and the importance of dynamic hedging are further illustrated through a profit and loss (P\u0026L) analysis for a large synthetic VA portfolio.

Also, upon the development of denseness theory in regression setting, we can heuristically interpret the LRMoE as a “fully flexible” model to capture any distributional, dependence and regression structures subject to a denseness condition. Further, the mathematical tractability of the LRMoE is guaranteed since it satisfies various marginalization and moment properties. Finally, we discuss some special choices of expert functions that make the corresponding LRMoE “fully flexible”. In the subsequent paper (Fung et al., 2019b), we will focus on the estimation and application aspects of the LRMoE.","tags":["Claim frequency and severity modeling","Denseness theory","Mixture of experts models","Multivariate regression analysis","Neural network"],"title":"A class of mixture of experts models for general insurance: Theoretical developments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrei L.

A model comprises a vector of random input factors, an aggregation function mapping input factors to a random output, and a (baseline) probability measure. A risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, maps the distribution of the output to the real line. As is common in risk management, the value of the risk measure applied to the output is a decision variable. Therefore, it is of interest to associate a critical increase in the risk measure to specific input factors. We propose a global and model-independent framework, termed ‘reverse sensitivity testing’, comprising three steps: (a) an output stress is specified, corresponding to an increase in the risk measure(s); (b) a (stressed) probability measure is derived, minimising the Kullback–Leibler divergence with respect to the baseline probability, under constraints generated by the output stress; (c) changes in the distributions of input factors are evaluated. We argue that a substantial change in the distribution of an input factor corresponds to high sensitivity to that input and introduce a novel sensitivity measure to formalise this insight. Implementation of reverse sensitivity testing in a Monte Carlo setting can be performed on a single set of input/output scenarios, simulated under the baseline model. Thus the approach circumvents the need for additional computationally expensive evaluations of the aggregation function. We illustrate the proposed approach through numerical examples with a simple insurance portfolio and a model of a London Insurance Market portfolio used in industry.","tags":["Robustness and sensitivity analysis","Risk management","Value-at-Risk","Expected Shortfall","Stress testing"],"title":"Reverse sensitivity testing: What does it take to break the model?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon C.

Similar to the popular Gradient Boosting (GB), this new member is presented as a forward stagewise additive model that attempts to reduce the loss at each iteration by sequentially fitting a simple base learner to complement the running predictions. Instead of relying on the negative gradient, as is the case for GB, DB adopts a new measure called delta as the basis. Delta is defined as the loss minimizer at an observation level. We also show that DB is the optimal boosting member for a wide range of loss functions. The optimality is a consequence of DB solving for the split and adjustment simultaneously to maximize loss reduction at each iteration. In addition, we introduce an asymptotic version of DB that works well for all twice-differentiable strictly convex loss functions. This asymptotic behavior does not depend on the number of observations, but rather on a high number of iterations that can be augmented through common regularization techniques. We show that the basis in the asymptotic extension differs from the basis in GB only by a multiple of the second derivative of the log-likelihood. The multiple is considered to be a correction factor, one that corrects the bias toward the observations with high second derivatives in GB. When negative log-likelihood is used as the loss function, this correction can be interpreted as a credibility adjustment for the process variance. Simulation studies and real data application we conducted suggest that DB is a significant improvement over GB. The performance of the asymptotic version is less dramatic, but the improvement is still compelling. Like GB, DB provides a high transparency to users, and we can review the marginal influence of variables through relative importance charts and the partial dependence plots. We can also assess the overall model performance through evaluating the losses, lifts, and double lifts on the holdout sample.

In our reinsurance arrangement, we also assume that both insurer and reinsurer are obligated to pay more for a larger realization of loss as a way of reducing ex post moral hazard. A key contribution of this article is to expand the research on optimal reinsurance by deriving explicit optimal reinsurance solutions under an economic premium principle. It is a rather general class of premium principles that includes many weighted premium principles as special cases. The advantage of adopting such a premium principle is that the resulting reinsurance premium depends not only on the risk ceded but also on a market economic factor that reflects the market environment or the risk the reinsurer is facing. This feature appears to be more consistent with the reinsurance market. We show that the optimal reinsurance policies are piecewise linear under both VaR and CVaR risk measures. While the structures of optimal reinsurance solutions are the same for both risk measures, we also formally show that there are some significant differences, particularly on the managing tail risk. Because of the integration of the market factor (via the reinsurance pricing) into the optimal reinsurance model, some new insights on the optimal reinsurance design could be gleaned, which would otherwise be impossible for many of the existing models. For example, the market factor has a nontrivial effect on the optimal reinsurance, which is greatly influenced by the changes of the joint distribution of the market factor and the loss. Finally, under an additional assumption that the market factor and the loss have a copula with quadratic sections, we demonstrate that the optimal reinsurance policies admit relatively simple forms to foster the applicability of our theoretical results, and a numerical example is presented to further highlight our results.

From a practical perspective, a risk measure should also be robust, that is, insensitive to small perturbations in input assumptions. It is known in the literature [14, 39], that strong assumptions on the risk measure’s ability to distinguish between risks may lead to a lack of robustness. We address the trade-off between robustness and consistent risk ranking by specifying the regions in the space of distribution functions, where law-invariant convex risk measures are indeed robust. Examples include the set of random variables with bounded second moment and those that are less volatile (in convex order) than random variables in a given uniformly integrable set. Typically, a risk measure is evaluated on the output of an aggregation function defined on a set of random input vectors. Extending the definition of robustness to this setting, we find that law-invariant convex risk measures are robust for any aggregation function that satisfies a linear growth condition in the tail, provided that the set of possible marginals is uniformly integrable. Thus, we obtain that all law-invariant convex risk measures possess the aggregation-robustness property introduced by [26] and further studied by [40]. This is in contrast to the widely-used, non-convex, risk measure Value-at-Risk, whose robustness in a risk aggregation context requires restricting the possible dependence structures of the input vectors.","tags":[],"title":"Robustness regions for measures of risk aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roel Verbelen","Lan Gong","Katrien Antonio","Andrei Badescu","Sheldon Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653959967,"objectID":"5c499119dadca3fe9b4853298b3ef522","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/publication/verbelen-gong-antonio-badescu-lin-2015/","publishdate":"2022-11-12T14:58:25.221039Z","relpermalink":"/publication/verbelen-gong-antonio-badescu-lin-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"We discuss how to fit mixtures of Erlangs to censored and truncated data by iteratively using the EM algorithm.

We further assume that the optimization criterion preserves the convex order. Such a criterion is very general as most of the criteria for optimal reinsurance problems in the literature preserve the convex order.

Hyper-exponential and mixed-Erlang distributed claims are considered in some detail.","tags":["Gerber–Shiu expected discounted penalty function","Integro-differential equation","Singular perturbation theory","Stochastic volatility","Perturbed compound Poisson risk process","Phase-type distribution","Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process"],"title":"An insurance risk model with stochastic volatility","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/courses/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60abaeb405147d861bb55801d25d30df","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"21e663c1b3575996cdbb4c33539ad396","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/people-uoftactuarial/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people-uoftactuarial/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"850d3285b9d4b0dba29acf3237d91a0c","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/tools/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tools/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tools","type":"widget_page"}]
