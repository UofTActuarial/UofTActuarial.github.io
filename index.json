Moreover, our analysis is based solely on telematics data, requiring no traditional covariates such as driver or vehicle characteristics. Through unsupervised anomaly detection based on pseudo-residuals, we identify deviations from normal driving patterns—defined as the prevalent behaviour observed in a driver’s history or across the population—which are linked to accident risk. Validated on both controlled and real-world datasets, the CTHMM effectively detects abnormal driving behaviour and trips with increased accident likelihood. In real data analysis, higher anomaly levels in longitudinal and lateral accelerations consistently correlate with greater accident risk, with classification models using this information achieving ROC-AUC values as high as 0.86 for trip-level analysis and 0.78 for distinguishing drivers with claims. Furthermore, the methodology reveals significant behavioural differences between drivers with and without claims, offering valuable insights for insurance applications, accident analysis, and prevention.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing driving risk through unsupervised detection of anomalies in telematics time series data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tsz Chai Fung","Spark C.

Through a detailed discussion of the telematics data structure and related data quality issues, we elaborate on practical challenges in processing and incorporating telematics information in loss modeling and ratemaking.

Our regression analysis reiterates the importance of telematics data in claims modeling; in particular, we propose a speed transition matrix that describes discretely recorded speed time series and produces statistically significant predictors for claim counts. We conclude that large speed transitions, together with higher maximum speed attained, nighttime driving, and increased harsh braking, are associated with increased claim counts. Moreover, we empirically illustrate the learning effects in driving behavior: we show that both severe harsh events detected at a high threshold and expected claim counts are not directly proportional with driving time or distance but they increase at a decreasing rate.

Most data-driven models used for this task are mathematically intractable, and premiums must be obtained through numerical methods such as simulation via MCMC. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and even prohibitive for large portfolios when applied at the policyholder level. Additionally, these computations become “black-box” procedures as there is no analytical expression showing how the claim history of policyholders is used to upgrade their premiums. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a surrogate modeling approach to inexpensively derive an analytical expression for computing the Bayesian premiums for any given model, approximately. As a part of the methodology, the paper introduces a likelihood-based summary statistic of the policyholder's claim history that serves as the main input of the surrogate model and that is sufficient for certain families of distribution, including the exponential dispersion family. As a result, the computational burden of experience rating for large portfolios is reduced through the direct evaluation of such analytical expression, which can provide a transparent and interpretable way of computing Bayesian premiums.","tags":["Credibility","Surrogate modeling","Ratemaking","Bayesian regression","Experience rating"],"title":"Effective experience rating for large insurance portfolios via surrogate modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Blier-Wong","Hélène Cossette","Etienne Marceau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731117517,"objectID":"354582e49f69e1fa4b793e177a2f0737","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/publication/blierwong-cossette-marceau-2024/","publishdate":"2025-05-26T20:04:00.294569Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blierwong-cossette-marceau-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Copulas provide a powerful and flexible tool for modeling the dependence structure of random vectors, and they have many applications in finance, insurance, engineering, hydrology, and other fields. One well-known class of copulas in two dimensions is the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM) copula, since its simple analytic shape enables closed-form solutions to many problems in applied probability. However, the classical definition of the high-dimensional FGM copula does not enable a straightforward understanding of the effect of the copula parameters on the dependence, nor a geometric understanding of their admissible range. We circumvent this issue by analyzing the FGM copula from a probabilistic approach based on multivariate Bernoulli distributions. This paper examines high-dimensional exchangeable FGM copulas, a subclass of FGM copulas. We show that the dependence parameters of exchangeable FGM copulas can be expressed as a convex hull of a finite number of extreme points. We also leverage the probabilistic interpretation to develop efficient sampling and estimating procedures and provide a simulation study.

Reverse stress testing, in contrast to (forward) stress testing, aims to find an alternative but plausible model such that under that alternative model, specific adverse stresses (i.e. constraints) are satisfied. Here, we propose a reverse stress testing framework for dynamic models. Specifically, we consider a compound Poisson process over a finite time horizon and stresses composed of expected values of functions applied to the process at the terminal time. We then define the stressed model as the probability measure under which the process satisfies the constraints and which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the reference compound Poisson model. We solve this optimization problem, prove existence and uniqueness of the stressed probability measure, and provide a characterization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative from the reference model to the stressed model. We find that under the stressed measure, the intensity and the severity distribution of the process depend on time and state, and hence the stressed model is not a compound Poisson process. We illustrate the dynamic stress testing by considering stresses on VaR and both VaR and CVaR jointly and provide illustrations of how the stochastic process is altered under these stresses. We generalize the framework to multivariate compound Poisson processes and stresses at times other than the terminal time. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by considering “what if” scenarios, where we answer the question: What is the severity of a stress on a portfolio component at an earlier time such that the aggregate portfolio exceeds a risk threshold at the terminal time? Furthermore, for general constraints, we propose an algorithm to simulate sample paths under the stressed measure, thus allowing to compare the effects of stresses on the dynamics of the process.","tags":[],"title":"Stressing dynamic loss models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1678838400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678838400,"objectID":"5a733d1689aa3cd53576db4ea5db7b35","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/event/cas-rpm-2023/","publishdate":"2023-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/cas-rpm-2023/","section":"event","summary":"Slides to our CAS RPM talk 'Mixture-of-Experts Models for Claim Frequency and Severity'.","tags":null,"title":"Casualty Actuarial Society Ratemaking, Product and Modeling Seminar 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":["Silvana M Pesenti","Pietro Millossovich","Andreas Tsanakas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718582092,"objectID":"2491389094021c6d5d6b54c9d3ba72b3","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/publication/pesenti-millossovich-tsanakas-2023/","publishdate":"2025-05-26T20:03:54.835152Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pesenti-millossovich-tsanakas-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Differential sensitivity measures provide valuable tools for interpreting complex computational models used in applications ranging from simulation to algorithmic prediction.

For risk measures that are not positively homogeneous of degree 1, however, known capital allocation principles do not apply. We study the class of lambda quantile risk measures that includes the well-known Value-at-Risk as a special case but for which no known allocation rule is applicable.

For this purpose, we define lambda quantiles on the space of portfolio compositions and consider generic (also non-linear) portfolio operators. We further derive the Euler decomposition of lambda quantiles for generic portfolios and show that lambda quantiles are homogeneous in the space of portfolio compositions, with a homogeneity degree that depends on the portfolio composition and the lambda function. This result is in stark contrast to the positive homogeneity properties of risk measures defined in the space of random variables, which admit a constant homogeneity degree.

Hedging the market risks is therefore crucial in risk managing a VA portfolio as the VA guarantees are long-dated liability that may span over decades. In order to hedge the VA liability, the issuing insurance company would need to construct a hedging portfolio consisting of the underlying assets whose positions are often determined by the liability Greeks such as partial dollar Deltas. Usually, these quantities are calculated via nested simulation. For insurance companies that manage large VA portfolios (e.g.,100K+ policies), calculating those quantities is extremely time-consuming or even prohibitive due to the complexity of the guarantee payoffs and the stochastic-on-stochastic nature of the nested simulation algorithm. In this paper, we extend the surrogate model-assisted nest simulation approach in Lin \u0026Yang (2020) to efficiently calculate the total VA liability and the partial dollar Deltas for large VA portfolios with multiple underlying assets. In our proposed algorithm, the nested simulation is run using small sets of selected representative policies and representative outer-loops. As a result, the computing time is substantially reduced. The computational advantage of the proposed algorithm and the importance of dynamic hedging are further illustrated through a profit and loss (P\u0026L) analysis for a large synthetic VA portfolio. Moreover, the robustness of the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested with multiple simulation runs. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is able to accurately approximate different quantities of interest and the performance is robust with respect to different sets of parameter inputs.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient dynamic hedging for large variable annuity portfolios with multiple underlying assets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

Further, the mathematical tractability of the LRMoE is guaranteed since it satisfies various marginalization and moment properties.

A model comprises a vector of random input factors, an aggregation function mapping input factors to a random output, and a (baseline) probability measure. A risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, maps the distribution of the output to the real line. As is common in risk management, the value of the risk measure applied to the output is a decision variable. Therefore, it is of interest to associate a critical increase in the risk measure to specific input factors. We propose a global and model-independent framework, termed ‘reverse sensitivity testing’, comprising three steps: (a) an output stress is specified, corresponding to an increase in the risk measure(s); (b) a (stressed) probability measure is derived, minimising the Kullback–Leibler divergence with respect to the baseline probability, under constraints generated by the output stress; (c) changes in the distributions of input factors are evaluated. We argue that a substantial change in the distribution of an input factor corresponds to high sensitivity to that input and introduce a novel sensitivity measure to formalise this insight. Implementation of reverse sensitivity testing in a Monte Carlo setting can be performed on a single set of input/output scenarios, simulated under the baseline model. Thus the approach circumvents the need for additional computationally expensive evaluations of the aggregation function. We illustrate the proposed approach through numerical examples with a simple insurance portfolio and a model of a London Insurance Market portfolio used in industry.","tags":["Robustness and sensitivity analysis","Risk management","Value-at-Risk","Expected Shortfall","Stress testing"],"title":"Reverse sensitivity testing: What does it take to break the model?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon C.

Similar to the popular Gradient Boosting (GB), this new member is presented as a forward stagewise additive model that attempts to reduce the loss at each iteration by sequentially fitting a simple base learner to complement the running predictions. Instead of relying on the negative gradient, as is the case for GB, DB adopts a new measure called delta as the basis. Delta is defined as the loss minimizer at an observation level. We also show that DB is the optimal boosting member for a wide range of loss functions. The optimality is a consequence of DB solving for the split and adjustment simultaneously to maximize loss reduction at each iteration. In addition, we introduce an asymptotic version of DB that works well for all twice-differentiable strictly convex loss functions. This asymptotic behavior does not depend on the number of observations, but rather on a high number of iterations that can be augmented through common regularization techniques. We show that the basis in the asymptotic extension differs from the basis in GB only by a multiple of the second derivative of the log-likelihood. The multiple is considered to be a correction factor, one that corrects the bias toward the observations with high second derivatives in GB. When negative log-likelihood is used as the loss function, this correction can be interpreted as a credibility adjustment for the process variance. Simulation studies and real data application we conducted suggest that DB is a significant improvement over GB. The performance of the asymptotic version is less dramatic, but the improvement is still compelling. Like GB, DB provides a high transparency to users, and we can review the marginal influence of variables through relative importance charts and the partial dependence plots.

In this comment, we build on Major’s (2018) insights but take a somewhat different direction, to consider Euler capital allocations for distortion risk measures directly applied to homogeneous portfolios.

As such, it is a useful model to fit insurance loss data and to calculate quantities of interest for insurance risk management. In this paper, we propose a generalized expectation–maximization (GEM) algorithm along with a clusterized method of moments (CMM) to estimate the model parameters. The GEM algorithm not only estimates the mixing weights and scale parameter of the model but also estimates the shape parameters of the model using a local search method. The CMM method enables to produce quality initial estimates for the GEM algorithm. As a result, the proposed approach provides an efficient algorithm that can fit the model to the body and the tail of truncated and censored loss data well and converges fast. We examine the performance of the proposed approach through several simulation studies and apply it to fit the Erlang mixture model to two real loss data sets.","tags":["Erlang mixture model","Insurance loss data","Generalized EM algorithm","Clusterized method of moments","Local search method"],"title":"Fitting the Erlang mixture model to data via a GEM-CMM algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yichun Chi","X.

In our reinsurance arrangement, we also assume that both insurer and reinsurer are obligated to pay more for a larger realization of loss as a way of reducing ex post moral hazard. A key contribution of this article is to expand the research on optimal reinsurance by deriving explicit optimal reinsurance solutions under an economic premium principle. It is a rather general class of premium principles that includes many weighted premium principles as special cases. The advantage of adopting such a premium principle is that the resulting reinsurance premium depends not only on the risk ceded but also on a market economic factor that reflects the market environment or the risk the reinsurer is facing. This feature appears to be more consistent with the reinsurance market. We show that the optimal reinsurance policies are piecewise linear under both VaR and CVaR risk measures. While the structures of optimal reinsurance solutions are the same for both risk measures, we also formally show that there are some significant differences, particularly on the managing tail risk. Because of the integration of the market factor (via the reinsurance pricing) into the optimal reinsurance model, some new insights on the optimal reinsurance design could be gleaned, which would otherwise be impossible for many of the existing models. For example, the market factor has a nontrivial effect on the optimal reinsurance, which is greatly influenced by the changes of the joint distribution of the market factor and the loss. Finally, under an additional assumption that the market factor and the loss have a copula with quadratic sections, we demonstrate that the optimal reinsurance policies admit relatively simple forms to foster the applicability of our theoretical results, and a numerical example is presented to further highlight our results.

To calculate IBNR reserve, one needs to model claim arrivals and then predict IBNR claims. However, factors such as temporal dependence among claim arrivals and environmental variation are often not incorporated in many of the current loss reserving models, which may greatly affect the accuracy of IBNR predictions. In this paper, we propose to model the claim arrival process together with its reporting delays as a marked Cox process. Our model is versatile in modeling temporal dependence, allowing also for natural interpretations. This paper focuses mainly on the theoretical aspects of the proposed model. We show that the associated reported claim process and IBNR claim process are both marked Cox processes with easily convertible intensity functions and marking distributions. The proposed model can also account for fluctuations in the exposure. By an order statistics property, we show that the corresponding discretely observed process preserves all the information about the claim arrivals. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions for both the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the distributions of the numbers of reported claims and IBNR claims.

From a practical perspective, a risk measure should also be robust, that is, insensitive to small perturbations in input assumptions. It is known in the literature [14, 39], that strong assumptions on the risk measure’s ability to distinguish between risks may lead to a lack of robustness. We address the trade-off between robustness and consistent risk ranking by specifying the regions in the space of distribution functions, where law-invariant convex risk measures are indeed robust. Examples include the set of random variables with bounded second moment and those that are less volatile (in convex order) than random variables in a given uniformly integrable set. Typically, a risk measure is evaluated on the output of an aggregation function defined on a set of random input vectors. Extending the definition of robustness to this setting, we find that law-invariant convex risk measures are robust for any aggregation function that satisfies a linear growth condition in the tail, provided that the set of possible marginals is uniformly integrable. Thus, we obtain that all law-invariant convex risk measures possess the aggregation-robustness property introduced by [26] and further studied by [40]. This is in contrast to the widely-used, non-convex, risk measure Value-at-Risk, whose robustness in a risk aggregation context requires restricting the possible dependence structures of the input vectors.","tags":[],"title":"Robustness regions for measures of risk aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roel Verbelen","Lan Gong","Katrien Antonio","Andrei Badescu","Sheldon Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653959967,"objectID":"5c499119dadca3fe9b4853298b3ef522","permalink":"https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/publication/verbelen-gong-antonio-badescu-lin-2015/","publishdate":"2025-05-26T20:03:38.36214Z","relpermalink":"/publication/verbelen-gong-antonio-badescu-lin-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"We discuss how to fit mixtures of Erlangs to censored and truncated data by iteratively using the EM algorithm.

In order to reduce the moral hazard, we assume that both the insurer and the reinsurer are obligated to pay more as the amount of loss increases in a typical reinsurance treaty. We further assume that the optimization criterion preserves the convex order. Such a criterion is very general as most of the criteria for optimal reinsurance problems in the literature preserve the convex order. When the reinsurance premium is calculated as a function of the actuarial value of coverage, we show via a stochastic dominance approach that any admissible reinsurance policy is dominated by a stop-loss reinsurance or a two-layer reinsurance, depending upon the amount of the reinsurance premium. Moreover, we obtain a similar result to Mossin's Theorem and find that it is optimal for the insurer to cede a loss as much as possible under the net premium principle. To further examine the reinsurance premium for the optimal piecewise linear reinsurance policy, we assume the expected value premium principle and derive the optimal reinsurance explicitly under (1) the criterion of minimizing the variance of the insurer's risk exposure, and (2) the criterion of minimizing the risk-adjusted value of the insurer's liability where the liability valuation is carried out using the cost-of-capital approach based on the conditional value at risk.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal reinsurance with limited ceded risk: A stochastic dominance approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yichun Chi","X.

A separate account termed as sub-account is set up for the investment. Unlike a mutual fund, a VA offers a guaranteed minimum death benefit or GMDB and often offers a guaranteed minimum living benefit or GMLB during the accumulation phase of the VA contract. Almost all the research to date has focused on single premium variable annuities (SPVAs), i.e. it is assumed that an annuitant makes a single lump-sum contribution at the time of issue. In this paper, we study flexible premium variable annuities (FPVAs) that allow contributions during the accumulation phase. We derive a valuation formula for guarantees embedded in FPVAs and show that the delta hedging strategy for an FPVA is substantially different from that for an SPVA. The numerical examples illustrate that the cost in the form of mortality and expense (M\u0026E) fee for an FPVA in many situations is significantly higher than the cost for a similar SPVA. This finding suggests that the current pricing practice by most VA providers that charges the same M\u0026E fee for both should be re-examined.","tags":[],"title":"Are Flexible Premium Variable Annuities Under-Priced?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yichun Chi","X.
